# CDD calculator

This code takes the .epw files in the folder and calculates the Cooling Degree Days by as many temperature thresholds as it's needed.
The thresholds are defined by the global variable "THRESHOLDS", which is a list of the chosen temperature thresholds.

## CDH

If the intention is to get the value for CDH (Cooling Degree Hours), you can set the global variable "CDH" as True.
